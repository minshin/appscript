# appscript
Tools for processing data in google sheet

Tmall cs dialog can only be stored for 3 months, I need save and format the dialog in google sheet by app script.
Steps:
1. Log into tmall management.
2. Go to cs dialog history page.
3. Copy and paste dialog to google sheet.
4. Run convertChatList.gs.
5. Formatted dialog will be in "New Chat".

Next:
Dialog will be used as data source for ML/GPT, and train a bot to act as a cs.
